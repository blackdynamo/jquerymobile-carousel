You must use the jquery.ui.ipad.js plugin in order for jQuery UI widgets to recognize mobile touch events as click events.

Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/blackdynamo/yxhzU/

Available options:

duration: this is the number of milliseconds for the slide transition to happen.
direction: whether the carousel is a "horizontal" or "vertical" carousel.
minimumDrag: this is the minimum distance the carousel has to be dragged in order to trigger the page change.
beforeStart: callback that will be called right as the drag event is triggered. "this" = the jQuery(list)
afterStart: callback that will be called right after the start event is triggered. "this" = the jQuery(list)
beforeStop: callback that will be called right as the drag has stopped. "this" = the jQuery(list)
beforeStart: callback that will be called right after the drag has stopped. "this" = the jQuery(list)
